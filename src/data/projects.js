    description: 'Chill n Drink is a custom-built Arduino-powered device that rapidly chills canned drinks using a combination of ice water immersion and motorized spinning. By placing a can on the platform and inserting a coin, the system activates and spins the drink in ice water, cooling it in under 1 minuteâ€”equivalent to 30 minutes in a freezer. Built from scratch, the device showcases skills in embedded systems, mechanical design, circuit integration, and user-triggered automation. It\'s designed to be user-friendly, cost-effective, and efficient for fast beverage cooling in casual or event settings.',
