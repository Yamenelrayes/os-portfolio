PROJECT IMAGES INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

The portfolio now supports multiple images per project. Follow these naming conventions:

1. For each project, add multiple numbered images:
   - Example: For the "FitPose" project, add:
     * fitpose-1.png (primary/thumbnail image)
     * fitpose-2.png (additional image)
     * fitpose-3.png (additional image)
     * etc.

2. The first image (e.g., fitpose-1.png) will be used as the thumbnail on the projects grid.

3. All images will be available in a gallery with navigation arrows in the project detail view.

Image recommendations:
1. Size: 1200x675px (16:9 ratio) for best appearance
2. Format: PNG, JPG, or WEBP 
3. File size: Keep under 200KB for optimal performance
4. Style: Use consistent styling across all project images for a professional look

Example image names based on your current projects:
- FitPose: fitpose-1.png, fitpose-2.png, fitpose-3.png
- SpendWise: spendwise-1.png, spendwise-2.png, spendwise-3.png
- Battleships: battleships-1.png, battleships-2.png, battleships-3.png
- Blue Snake: bluesnake-1.png, bluesnake-2.png, bluesnake-3.png
